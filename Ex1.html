    <p>Most fundamentally, when you look at a webpage in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser">Web browser</a>, you see words. But most of the time webpages contain styled text rather than plain text.  Nowadays, webpage designers have access to hundreds of different fonts, font sizes, colors, and even alphabets (e.g. Spanish, Japanese, Russian), and browsers can for the most part display them accurately. Webpages may also contain images, video clips, and background music. They may include drop-down menus, search boxes, or links you can follow to access other pages (whether on the same site or another site). Some websites even let visitors customize the page display to accommodate their preferences and challenges (e.g., sight challenges, deafness, or color blindness). Often a page contains content boxes that move (scroll) while the rest of the page remains static.</p>
